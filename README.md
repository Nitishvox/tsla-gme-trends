# tsla-gme-trends
Analyze and visualize Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) stock price trends alongside their quarterly revenue using Python.  This project uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data, scrapes revenue data from Macrotrends, and creates dual-axis graphs with matplotlib to explore the relationship between stock performance and company revenue.
